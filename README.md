# hello-world
This is my GitHub introduction.

Hey everyone! My name is Kayla and I'm 28 years old.
I live in San Diego with my husband and our two dogs, Cooper and Cole.
I love to spend time relaxing at home (because California doesn't give us much of an option..)
But I also love traveling and exploring new places.
